## ‚ö° Self Public Projects I've worked on:
`` **NOTE:** These project do not involves any government project or classified data.``

1. **News Kotlin Multiplatform App (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux):** News KMP App is a Kotlin Compose Multiplatform (KMP) project that aims to provide a consistent news reading experience across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux. This project leverages Kotlin's multiplatform capabilities to share code and logic while using Compose for UI, ensuring a seamless and native experience on each platform
2. **Coding Meet Kobweb (Website):** Coding Meet Kobweb is my personal portfolio website built using Kobweb. It showcases my projects, services, blog articles, and achievements. The website features smooth animations, organized sections, and an interactive UI for visitors.
3. **Gemini AI Kotlin Multiplatform App (Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and Web):** Gemini AI KMP App is a Kotlin Compose Multiplatform project designed by Gemini AI where you can retrieve information from text and images in a conversational format. Additionally, it allows storing chats group-wise using SQLDelight and KStore, and facilitates changing the Gemini API key.
4. **String Translator Desktop App:** String Translator Desktop App is a powerful desktop application built with Jetpack Compose, aiming to streamline the translation of strings for developers. It empowers users to seamlessly translate multiple strings into various languages, thereby optimizing the localization process.
5. **Custom LCD Pattern Generator (Android App):** An Android application that generates Arduino C code for a given pattern. This app is available on the Play Store and has garnered over 1,000 downloads.
6. **Home Automation System (IoT, Android App):** This project presents an Arduino-based real-time home automation system that allows users to remotely control and monitor home appliances like fans, lights, etc., using a mobile application. The system stores real-time data on the cloud, providing access from anywhere. The implementation integrates NodeMCU ESP8266 Wi-Fi Module, relay module, and IR receiver for communication and control. The Android application facilitates authentication, device control, and appliance state monitoring.
7. **Electric Vehicle (IoT):** This project demonstrates an electric vehicle powered by a 3-phase induction motor controlled using the Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique. The Arduino microcontroller efficiently manages the motor's speed and direction through precise pulse control, ensuring optimal performance. The system is designed for improved energy efficiency and enhanced motor control for electric vehicle applications.
8. **Quillbot Web Scraping (Python):** The Quillbot Web Scraper is an automation tool designed to streamline content rewriting tasks. It leverages Selenium WebDriver to interact with Quillbot's web interface and Apache POI to read and write content in Excel sheets. The tool efficiently handles large text by dynamically splitting content, automates text submission, and retrieves the rewritten content for seamless workflow integration.
9. **Multifactor Authenticator App:** An authenticator app is an Android application designed to provide an additional layer of security to online accounts. The app generates a unique, time-based code that is used to verify the user's identity when logging into an account. This code is typically valid for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds, and is generated using a secret key shared between the authenticator app and the online account. Authenticator apps are commonly used to provide two-factor authentication (2FA) to online accounts, which requires users to provide both a password and a verification code generated by the authenticator app. This makes it much more difficult for hackers to gain access to the user's account.
10. **Daily Affirmation (Android App):** Daily Affirmation with Wallpaper is a mobile application designed to provide daily affirmations and positive quotes to users, combined with a wallpaper feature that displays beautiful and inspiring images. The app aims to help users start their day on a positive note, increase their self-confidence, and improve their overall well-being.
11. **Math Workout - Brain Exercise:** This app offers an array of math challenges, from addition to square roots, making it an engaging tool for brain training.
12. **Trivia App:** A mobile application that allows users to answer questions across various categories and difficulty levels.
13. **MeetMyShow (Android App):** An online movie ticket booking app developed in Kotlin, akin to the BookMyShow platform.
14. **Android Addict (Website):** A React-based website providing Android component code for developers.
15. **Gamer's Arena (Android App):** An Android app designed for hosting and joining gaming tournaments and events.
